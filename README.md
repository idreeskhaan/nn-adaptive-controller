# Neural network based adaptive controller for end-effector tracking of redundant manipulators

<p>This document explores the neural network based
adaptive controller for redundant manipulators developed in
[1], aiming to implement it for the trajectory tracking of an endeffector in the x, y z cartesian space. The control scheme is based on estimating the robot dynamic matrices with neural networks and changing the neural network parameters using adaptive
control theory. The robot model is a 4 degrees of freedom
redundant manipulator and it was implemented in MATLAB
Simulink. After implementing the robot model and starting to
implement the controller, a dimension mismatch presented a
significant obstacle in the implementation of the adaptation laws
for the neural network parameters. Due to this obstacle, the
adaptation laws were not fully implemented. The results
obtained show the end-effector following a trajectory similar in
shape to the desired trajectory, but without tracking it. It is
concluded that further analysis needs to be performed with the
stability analysis that the authors did in order to resolve the
mismatch in the dimensions</p>
